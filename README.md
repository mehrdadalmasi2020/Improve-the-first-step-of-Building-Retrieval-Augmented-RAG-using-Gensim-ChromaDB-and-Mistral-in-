# Improve the first step of building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Gensim, ChromaDB, and Mistral inÂ Python.

Here, we learn how to change the transformer for ChromaDB to something else, insert data into ChromaDB, and answer queries.
Vector Databases are essential for many NLP applications, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG.
ChromaDB is one of the efficient vector database management systems that can store the generated embedding vectors by different Language Language Models.
